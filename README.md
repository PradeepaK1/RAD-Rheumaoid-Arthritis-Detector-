# RAD-Rheumaoid-Arthritis-Detector-
Our detector comes up with the latest technologies computer vision with tensorflow this can measure the levels of CCP, CRP,RF, ANA and ESR in our blood level. Tensorflow is used to exclusively categorize images. Here the slide images are captured by computer vision and using tensorflow the classification occurs with the already trained images. The numerical quantity of the mentioned features are sent from tensorflow to KNN simulation code and it predicts the result accurately thus data is generated through the blood test report and is processed by machine learning concepts.
